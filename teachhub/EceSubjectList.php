 <b>1. Microprocessor(100pts):- is a computer processor that incorporates the functions of a central processing unit on a single integrated circuit (IC),[1] or at most a few integrated circuits.[2] The microprocessor is a multipurpose, clock driven, register based, digital integrated circuit that accepts binary data as input, processes it according to instructions stored in its memory, and provides results as output. Microprocessors contain both combinational logic and sequential digital logic. Microprocessors operate on numbers and symbols represented in the binary number system.

<b> 2. Signal and System(100 PTS):- In electrical engineering, the fundamental quantity of representing some information is called a signal. It does not matter what the information is i-e: Analog or digital information. In mathematics, a signal is a function that conveys some information. In fact any quantity measurable through time over space or any higher dimension can be taken as a signal. A signal could be of any dimension and could be of any form..</b>

<b>3. DATASTRUCTURE AND ALGORITHMS(100PTS):-Data Structure is a way of collecting and organising data in such a way that we can <BR>perform operations on these data in an effective way. Data Structures is about rendering data elements in terms of some <BR>relationship, for better organization and storage. For example, we have some data which has, player's name "Virat" and <BR>age 26. Here "Virat" is of String data type and 26 is of integer data type.<BR>

  In simple language, Data Structures are structures programmed to store ordered data, so that various operations can be <BR>performed on it easily. It represents the knowledge of data to be organized in memory. It should be designed and <BR>implemented in such a way that it reduces the complexity and increases the efficiency.<BR>

<B>4.Electromagnetic theory(EMT)(100PTS):-This course introduces students to handling electromagnetic theory using vector calculus. This enables students to handle problems that are more complicated than they are used to from their school <br>
days.  Due to general nature of the mathematics they learn in this course, what they learn here will help them in their <br>future courses like fluid dynamics that use similar mathematics

<B>5. Digital communication(100PTS):-
In the design of large and complex digital systems, it is often necessary to have one device communicate digital <br>information to and from other devices. One advantage of digital information is that it tends to be far more resistant to <br>transmitted and interpreted errors than information symbolized in an analog medium. This accounts for the clarity of <br>digitally-encoded telephone connections, compact audio disks, and for much of the enthusiasm in the engineering community<br> for digital communications technology. However, digital communication has its own unique pitfalls, and there are <br>multitudes of different and incompatible ways in which it can be sent. </B>

<b> 6. Object Oriented Programming(java)(100pts):-Java is a programming language created by James Gosling from Sun <br>Microsystems (Sun) in 1991. The target of Java is to write a program once and then run this program on multiple operating <br>systems. ... The Java platform is usually associated with the Java virtual machine and the Java core libraries
