 <b>1. Flow-control(100pts):- In data communications, flow control is the process of managing the rate of data <br>transmission between two nodes to prevent a fast sender from overwhelming a slow receiver. It provides a mechanism for<br> the receiver to control the transmission speed, so that the receiving node is not overwhelmed with data from <br><br>transmitting node. Flow control should be distinguished from congestion control, which is used for controlling the flow<br> of data when congestion has actually occurred.[1] Flow control mechanisms can be classified by whether or not the <br>receiving node sends feedback to the sending node.<br><br><br>

Flow control is important because it is possible for a sending computer to transmit information at a faster rate than the <br><br>destination computer can receive and process it. This can happen if the receiving computers have a heavy traffic load <br>in comparison to the sending computer, or if the receiving computer has less processing power than the sending <br>computer.

<b> 2. Signal and System(100 PTS):- In electrical engineering, the fundamental quantity of representing some information is called a signal. It does not matter what the information is i-e: Analog or digital information. In mathematics, a signal is a function that conveys some information. In fact any quantity measurable through time over space or any higher dimension can be taken as a signal. A signal could be of any dimension and could be of any form..</b>

<b>3. DATASTRUCTURE AND ALGORITHMS(100PTS):-Data Structure is a way of collecting and organising data in such a way that we can <BR>perform operations on these data in an effective way. Data Structures is about rendering data elements in terms of some <BR>relationship, for better organization and storage. For example, we have some data which has, player's name "Virat" and <BR>age 26. Here "Virat" is of String data type and 26 is of integer data type.<BR>

  In simple language, Data Structures are structures programmed to store ordered data, so that various operations can be <BR>performed on it easily. It represents the knowledge of data to be organized in memory. It should be designed and <BR>implemented in such a way that it reduces the complexity and increases the efficiency.<BR>

<B>4.Automata Theory(EMT)(100PTS):-We begin with a study of finite automata and the languages they can define (the <br>so-called "regular languages." Topics include deterministic and nondeterministic automata, regular expressions, and the <br>equivalence of these language-defining mechanisms. We also look at closure properties of the regular languages, e.g., the fact that the union of two regular languages is also a regular language. We consider decision properties of regular <br><br><br>languages, e.g., the fact that there is an algorithm to tell whether or not the language defined by two finite automata <br><br>are the same language. Finally, we see the pumping lemma for regular languages -- a way of proving that certain <br>languages are not regular languages.

<B>5. Shell Scripting(100PTS):-
A shell script is nothing but a script written for command line interpreter of an operating system. The shell script is <br>referred as simple domain-specific programming language. Shell script performs various operations such as program <br>execution, file manipulation, and printing text. DCL and JCL are the examples of the programming languages that are <br>intended for shell scripting. Like batch files, in shell scripts, the commands are programmed in chains and they are <br>executed as a scripting event by the system. Apart from these, they also help to perform more useful functions like as <br>command substitution. You are allowed to use programming functions like if/then/else statements, ‘for’ loops and so on,<br> with your operating system directly.

<b> 6. Object Oriented Programming(java)(100pts):-Java is a programming language created by James Gosling from Sun <br>Microsystems (Sun) in 1991. The target of Java is to write a program once and then run this program on multiple operating <br>systems. ... The Java platform is usually associated with the Java virtual machine and the Java core libraries

<b> 7. Engineering physics(100pts):-Engineering physics refers to the study of the combined disciplines of physics, <br>mathematics and combined with engineering studies in computer, electrical, materials or mechanical engineering. By <br>focussing on the scientific method as a rigorous basis, it seeks ways to apply and develop new solutions in engineering

<b>8. Engineering humaninties(100pts):-An introduction to the humanities through a review of some of the major <br>developments in human culture. The goal is to analyze how societies express their ideas through art, literature, music, r<be>eligion, and philosophy and to consider some of the underlying assumptions about the way societies are formed and run.
